- Need a good title.
- How are we dividing up the workload?
- What are our specific deliverables?
- Can we use a network trained on a specific component, or on the whole SDR, or both? What are the trade-offs?
- How are we going to allocate resources on the FPGA for this?

- Tasks (Corey):
1. Investigate the tradeoff of how many components to train the CNN.
2. Calculate resource requirement for different network types and compare/contrast.
3. How is the network trained?
	Pre-train network in software, and then drop the model into the two different hardware implementations.
- Tasks (Josh):
1. Perform the matrix multiplication (convolutional layer), then convert the signal to digital format for interfacing with FPGA
	Hardware acceleration of matrix multiplaction in CNN
2. Implement using FeFETs

- We will need to break the proposal up into deliverables and upload to canvas.
